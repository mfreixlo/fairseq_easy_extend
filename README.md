# Reinforcement Learning for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation

This repository is an example of [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) extension for NLP2 course. 

To use this extension, it's needed to download the [pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SS5UT4UCKJh7QCZJkrcyrMyC55l4INsH/view?usp=share_link) and add it in the repository location. Then it is enough to follow the ColabNotebook instructions to fine-tune and test the model.

The alteration in the repository were made on the [RL objective](fairseq_easy_extend/criterions/rl_criterion.py) and the [configuration file](fairseq_easy_extend/models/nat/cmlm_config.yaml)
